# Depression-Detection
A Transformer Based Approach for Depression Detection.

This project explores a novel approach to depression detection, combining MFCC features from speech with the power of Vision Transformers (ViT). After pre-processing data from three publicly available datasets, MFCCs were extracted to represent audio characteristics. These features were embedded into a ViT model, leveraging its attention mechanism to detect patterns associated with depression. This work highlights the potential of AI in mental health by fusing audio analysis with transformer-based models.
